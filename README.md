Erlang-Kademlia
===============


Experimental implementation of a distributed hash table in Erlang, following the Kademlia protocol/algorithm.

I've implemented this as a course project in Peer-to-Peer Computing in the summer '11 at Uppsala University. A [short documentation](documentation/overview/p2p-assignment-3.pdf) is available from what I've handed in back then.


The visualizations are created as GraphML files and have been manually rendered using the excellent free graphing software yEd.
