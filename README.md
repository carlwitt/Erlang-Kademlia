Experimental implementation of distributed hash table in Erlang, following the Kademlia protocol/algorithm.

I've implemented this as a course project in Peer-to-Peer Computing in the summer '11 at Uppsala University.
The visualizations are created as GraphML files and have been manually rendered using the excellent free graphing software yEd.
